# Sublime Text 2 atoum Plugin

A simple plugin to test php files with atoum like the [vim-plugin](https://github.com/mageekguy/atoum/wiki/atoum-et-VIM).

## Install

First of all, you need [atoum](https://github.com/mageekguy/atoum).

Intall the [PHAR file](http://downloads.atoum.org/nightly/mageekguy.atoum.phar) in for instance `/usr/local/bin`.

Finally, install the plugin with the [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

## Config

Change `atoum.sublime-settings` with your parameters which is accessible via the command panel, menu or the context menu. Changes are taken immediately.

You can activate the **light report** which will be shown in a **panel** not a tab.

```
{
    "php_command": "/opt/local/bin/php",
    "atoum_phar_file": "/usr/local/bin/mageekguy.atoum.phar",
    "use_light_report": true
}
```

## Usage

Default shorcuts are:

* `cmd+alt+s` on OSX or `ctrl+alt+a` on Linux and Windows: Test the current file
* `cmd+alt+d` on OSX or `ctrl+alt+d` on Linux and Windows: Test files in the current directory
